# Linear-Safety-Sentel2.0
# Linear Safety Sentinel

A real-time social engineering firewall for Linear users.

Built in response to a targeted workspace exploit, this tool flags:
- Suspicious team invites
- Channel-hopping (Telegram → WhatsApp → Google Meet)
- Fake onboarding setups
- Locked workspace entrapments

## How It Works

Paste any message, invite, or onboarding prompt.  
The Sentinel evaluates it for high-risk language, behavior patterns, and admin traps — all in real time.

### Built With

- React + Next.js
- Vercel (live deployment)
- No tracking, no data storage — just logic
